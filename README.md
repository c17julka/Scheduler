# Scheduler
This is a scheduler including a task list and a deadline list. It was made in inspiration to those physical copies of daily task schedulers. Therefore, the elements represent paper to create that "real-life"-scheduler feel.

## How to use
1. Download the scheduler code (duh!)
2. Extract it to your desired folder
3. Create 2 dummy JSONs on JSONbin.io. You can fill them in with whatever, such as { "test": "test" }
4. Copy your secret key from JSONbin and paste it in the "key" variable in main.js
5. Copy your bin IDs from JSONbin and paste them into "taskBin" and "deadLBin" respectively
6. Now you can open up the HTML file and use the scheduler to your desire.
